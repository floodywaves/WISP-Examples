Use class component if you need to maintain internal state
ex.
    Class Welconme extends React.Components{
        render(){
            return<h1>Hello, {this.prop.name}</h1>;
        }
    }
Use functional component if not (but can maintain state with hook)
    function Welcome(props){
        return <h1>Hello,{props.name}</h1>
         
    }

each card have own 

Lifting state -> the parent component will keep the state of card and pass cards as prop to card editor and card viewer
